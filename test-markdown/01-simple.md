# Introduction to Vector Databases

Vector databases are specialized database systems designed to store and query high-dimensional vector embeddings. These systems enable semantic search, where queries are matched based on meaning rather than exact keyword matches.

## Key Features

- **Semantic Search**: Find documents by meaning
- **Similarity Scoring**: Rank results by relevance
- **High Performance**: Optimized for vector operations
- **Scalability**: Handle millions of vectors

Vector databases are essential for modern AI applications including recommendation systems, question answering, and semantic search engines.
