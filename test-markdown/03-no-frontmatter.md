# Python for Data Science

Python has become the dominant language for data science and machine learning. Its simple syntax, extensive libraries, and active community make it ideal for both beginners and experts.

## Key Libraries

**NumPy** provides support for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

**Pandas** offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series data.

**Scikit-learn** is a comprehensive machine learning library with implementations of many algorithms.

**TensorFlow and PyTorch** are the leading deep learning frameworks.

Python's ecosystem makes it easy to go from data exploration to production deployment.
